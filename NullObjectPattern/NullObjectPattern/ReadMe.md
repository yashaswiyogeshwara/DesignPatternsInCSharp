# Null Object Pattern

 1. Instead of Null values uses a *Nothing Object*. This avoids using conditionals.
 2. Null object finds its applicability in many other patterns.
 3. When working on Composite Pattern try using Null Object Patten with the Leaf Nodes.	

 ##Project Info
 Automobile Repair Entry Software System.

 There is a **GearService** class that counts number of Gears in **Car**.
 
 #Problem to Solve
 When a Car is an Automatic, the **Car's Gear property** should becomes null. This creates conditional branching in the **GearService** class
 which should be avoided.
